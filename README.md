Inspired by [/r/startpages](https://www.reddit.com/r/startpages) and forked from [Tilde](https://github.com/cadejscroggins/tilde) by Cade Scroggins â€” a personal homepage for your browser that is functional and sexy.

## Usage

To go to a site, enter the corresponding key. To view the available sites and their keys, press `?`. If your input doesn't match any of the commands, a generic Google search will be triggered. For example:

* Entering `r` would redirect you to [www.reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com).
* Entering `t` would redirect you to [twitter.com](https://twitter.com).
* Entering `cats` would search [Google for cats](https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=cats).

On mobile, you can click the clock to focus the search input.

### Searching

You can search some of the sites by typing a colon after the site's key, followed by your search query. For example:

* Entering `g:tilde` would search [GitHub for tilde](https://github.com/search?q=tilde).
* Entering `imdb:butterfly effect` would search [IMDB for butterfly effect](http://www.imdb.com/find?ref_=nv_sr_fn&q=butterfly%20effect).

> Not all configured sites have a search function

### Specific Locations

You can go to a specific location on a site by typing a forward slash after the site's key, followed by the location on the site you'd like to be redirected to. For example:

* Entering `r/r/startpages` would redirect you to [www.reddit.com/r/startpages](https://www.reddit.com/r/startpages)
* Entering `t/altonbrown` would redirect you to [twitter.com/altonbrown](https://twitter.com/altonbrown).

### URL Redirects

If you enter in a full domain or URL, you will be redirected to said domain or URL. For example:

* Entering `lifehacker.com` would redirect you to [lifehacker.com](http://lifehacker.com/).
* Entering `https://smile.amazon.com` would redirect you to [smile.amazon.com](https://smile.amazon.com/).
